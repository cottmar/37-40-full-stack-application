## Full-Stack Auth

The Full-Stack Auth application implements a Login/Signup/Logout functionality for a back-end project. I specifically used the Sluggram application, linked below.
 Token persistency, using cookies, and form-validation is also implemented. Recent additions are Profile creation, with an update functionality. The createion/update use Bearer Auth and is stored in a redux reducer. The application uses React/Redux, as well as Thunk and Reporter Middleware.
